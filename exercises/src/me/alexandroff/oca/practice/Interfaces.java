//1. Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly.
//2. An interface is not required to have any methods.
//3. An interface may not be marked as final.
//4. All top-level interfaces are assumed to have public or default access,
//and they must include the abstract modifier in their definition.
//Therefore, marking an interface as private, protected, or final will trigger
//a compiler error, since this is incompatible with these assumptions.
//5. All non-default methods in an interface are assumed to have the modifiers
//abstract and public in their definition. Therefore, marking a method as
//private, protected, or final will trigger compiler errors as these are
//incompatible with the abstract and public keywords.

// Inheriting an Interface
//1. An interface that extends another interface, as well as an abstract class that
//implements an interface, inherits all of the abstract methods as its own abstract
//methods.
//2. The first concrete class that implements an interface, or extends an abstract class
//that implements an interface, must provide an implementation for all of the inherited
//abstract methods.
